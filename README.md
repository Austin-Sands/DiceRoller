three.js and ammo.js implementation for class project

As the documentation for Ammo.js is not the easiest to access a lof of the structure and implementation of three.js and Ammo.js was learned from examples on the 
THREE.js website. I also watched a video on Ammo.js implementation when running into issues, credit to the channel https://www.youtube.com/@flanniganable.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is a simple implementation of three.js and ammo.js used to create two six-sided dice objects. When you hover over the dice with the mouse they 
should be outlined in yellow. If clicked on, the outline will change to white and remain until the mouse is clicked anywhere except over a dice object. 
With the dice selected, you can roll the dice using the space bar. 

Thanks for looking at my work!

HOW TO RUN:
For now, I keep getting an error trying to connect to the IUPUI tesla server so unfortunately I can't host this on a web server. So in order to run this 
you will need to download the repository and run it on a local server. I ran mine with python.

Once the repository is downloaded, you want to open the folder location in a command window or open a command window and traverse to the Project1 folder.
Once in the directory, if using python run the command "py -m http.server". Once the local server is running, open a browser window and type in the url 
"http://localhost:8000/project1.html". The program should run from there.
